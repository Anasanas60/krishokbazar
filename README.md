## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or later)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/krishokbazar.git
cd krishokbazar
```

### 2. Set Up the Backend (API)

Navigate to the API directory and install the dependencies.

```bash
cd api
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the `api` directory and add the following variables. For the default SQLite setup, no changes are needed.

```env
# .env for api

# Server Port
PORT=5000

# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key
JWT_EXPIRE=90d

# Database (Defaults to SQLite)
# DB_DIALECT=sqlite
# DB_STORAGE=./db/krishokbazar.sqlite

# Set to true to re-run database migrations (deletes existing data)
FORCE_SYNC=false

# Set to true on first run to populate the database with sample data
SEED_DB=true
```

**Important:** On the first run, set `SEED_DB=true` in your `.env` file to populate the database with initial data. You can set it to `false` after the first successful run.

Now, start the backend server:

```bash
npm start
```

The API will be running at `http://localhost:5000`.

### 3. Set Up the Frontend (Client)

Open a new terminal, navigate to the client directory, and install the dependencies.

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the `client` directory and add the backend API URL.

```env
# .env for client
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

Now, run the client development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is busy).
